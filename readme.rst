Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Diamondback is a package which provides Digital Signal Processing ( DSP )
solutions, and complements AI frameworks, by defining components which filter,
model, and transform data.

Diamondback complements Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) frameworks, by
defining components which filter, model, and transform data into forms which
are useful in feature extraction and pattern recognition.

Diamondback also supports applications including cancellation, identification,
optimization, probabilistic modeling, rate adaptation, and serialization.

Details
~~~~~~~

Data collections are consistently expressed in native types,
including tuples, sets, lists, and dictionaries, with vector and matrix
types expressed in numpy arrays.  Complex or real types are supported as
appropriate.

Diamondback is defined in subpackages commons, filters, models, and
transforms.

`commons <https://larryturner.github.io/diamondback/diamondback.commons>`_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-   `Log <https://larryturner.github.io/diamondback/diamondback.commons#diamondback-commons-log-module>`_
    singleton instance which formats and writes log entries with a specified
    level and stream using the loguru package. Log entries contain an ISO-8601
    datetime and level.  Log uses lazy initialization to coexist with loguru.
    Dynamic stream redirection and level specification are supported.

-   `RestClient <https://larryturner.github.io/diamondback/diamondback.commons#diamondback-commons-restclient-module>`_
    instances define a client for simple REST service requests using the
    requests package.  An API and an elective dictionary of parameter strings
    are encoded to build a URL, elective binary or JSON data are defined in the
    body of a request, and a requests response containing JSON, text, or binary
    data is returned.  Proxy, timeout, and URL definition are supported.

-   `Serial <https://larryturner.github.io/diamondback/diamondback.commons#diamondback-commons-serial-module>`_
    singleton instance which encodes and decodes an instance or collection in
    BSON or JSON, and generates SHA3-256 codes, using the jsonpickle package.
    An instance may be an object or a collection, referenced by abstract or
    concrete types, and the instance will be correctly encoded and decoded,
    without custom encoding definitions.

    instances realize discrete difference equations of Finite Impulse
    Response ( FIR ) form. Instances are defined based on style,
    normalized frequency, order, cascade count, and complement, or
    forward coefficients. Root extraction, group delay, and frequency
    response evaluation are defined.

-   `GoertzelFilter <https://larryturner.github.io/diamondback/diamondback.filters#diamondback-filters-goertzelfilter-module>`_
    instances efficiently evaluate a Discrete Fourier Transform ( DFT )
    at a normalized frequency, based on a window filter and normalized
    frequency.

    than zero, supporting decimation and interpolation through localized
    polynomial approximation with no group delay.

-   `PolyphaseRateFilter <https://larryturner.github.io/diamondback/diamondback.filters#diamondback-filters-polyphaseratefilter-module>`_
    instances approximate a signal evaluated at an effective frequency
    equal to the product of the normalized frequency and a rate greater
    than zero, supporting decimation and interpolation through
    definition and application of a polyphase filter bank, a sequence
    of low pass filters with a common frequency response and a fractional
    sample difference in group delay. An appropriate stride is determined
    to realize the specified effective frequency without bias and with

    instances select and retain a state extracted to maximize the minimum
    distance between state members based on style and order. An
    opportunistic unsupervised learning model typically improves condition
    and numerical accuracy and reduces storage relative to alternative
    approaches including generalized linear inverse.

-   `GaussianModel <https://larryturner.github.io/diamondback/diamondback.models#diamondback-models-gaussianmodel-module>`_
    is a supervised learning probabilistic model instance which uses
    maximum likelihood estimation and regularization to maximize posterior
    probability and classify an incident signal.  Learns one distribution
    instance per class.

-   `GaussianMixtureModel <https://larryturner.github.io/diamondback/diamondback.models#diamondback-models-gaussianmixturemodel-module>`_
    is a semi-supervised learning probabilistic model instance which uses
    maximum likelihood estimation, regularization, and expectation
    maximization to maximize posterior probability and classify an incident
    signal.  Learns model instances of a specified order per class, where
    intra-class models capture mixture distributions.

    condition.

    discrete-time signal to a complex discrete-frequency signal, or a
    complex discrete-frequency signal to a real or complex discrete-time
    signal, in equivalent and reversible representations, based on a
    window filter and inverse.

-   `PsdTransform <https://larryturner.github.io/diamondback/diamondback.transforms#diamondback-transforms-psdtransform-module>`_
    is a singleton instance which realizes a Power Spectral Density ( PSD )
    which converts a real or complex discrete-time signal to a real
    discrete-frequency signal which estimates an aggregate power spectrum
    of the signal, based on a window filter, index, and spectrogram.
    A spectrogram constructs a time frequency representation of the power
    spectrum.

    upsampling operations, in equivalent and reversible representations.

Binder, which dynamically builds and deploys a docker container from a GitHub
repository, or installed from GitHub and run on a local system.
