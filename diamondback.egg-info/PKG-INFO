Description: Diamondback is a package which provides Digital Signal Processing
        ( DSP ) solutions, organized in the form of commons, filters,
        interfaces, models, and transforms.
        
        Diamondback complements Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) frameworks, by
        defining components which analyze, filter, extract, model, and transform
        data into forms which are useful in applications including pattern
        recognition, feature extraction, and optimization.
        
        Diamondback also facilitates classical signal processing solutions
        including communications, modeling, signal identification and extraction,
        and noise cancellation.
